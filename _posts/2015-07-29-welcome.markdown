The [Ocsigen][ocsigen] project finally has a blog. Here, you will find
news from the wider Ocsigen community, tutorials, and more.

Ocsigen encompasses the building blocks that you need in order to
efficiently develop Web applications in [OCaml][ocaml].  Among other
libraries and tools, Ocsigen provides:

- [js_of_ocaml][jsoo], which is a compiler from OCaml to JavaScript;

- [Ocsigen Server][os], which is a web server implemented in OCaml;

- [Lwt][lwt], which is a cooperative thread library for OCaml;

- [TyXML][tyxml], which is a library for generating valid HTML and SVG
  content; last but not least,

- [Eliom][eliom], which puts everything together to provide a modern
  language for developing web applications, with tight integration
  between client and server.

The blog content lives in a [Git repository][repo], and gets served by
means of the [GitHub Pages][githubpages] infrastructure. We welcome
contributions! Fork the repository, add a
[Markdown][markdown]-formatted article under `posts/`, and initiate a
[pull request][githubpr].

Happy hacking, and stay tuned!
