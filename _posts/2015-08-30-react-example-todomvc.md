[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks of today. A js_of_ocaml version using the React module is now available. Check out the [source code](https://github.com/slegrand45/examples_ocsigen/tree/master/jsoo/todomvc-react) and the [demo](http://slegrand45.github.io/examples_ocsigen.site/jsoo/todomvc-react/). Comments and pull requests are welcome!
