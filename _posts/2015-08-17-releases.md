We are happy to announce the releases of

- [Eliom 4.2](https://github.com/ocsigen/eliom/releases/tag/4.2)
- [Server 2.6](https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigenserver/releases/tag/2.6)
- [js_of_ocaml 2.6](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/releases/tag/2.6)
- [TyXML 3.5](https://github.com/ocsigen/tyxml/releases/tag/3.5.0)

We also welcome a new member in the ocsigen team, [Vasilis Papavasileiou](https://github.com/vasilisp).

Key changes in the various releases:

- PPX support for js_of_ocaml with OCaml >= 4.02.2.
  See documentation [here](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/2.6/api/Ppx_js).

  This was also the occasion to introduce a new syntax for object
  literals, and to improve the Camlp4 syntax (w.r.t. to
  locations). Both syntaxes emit the same code, and are perfectly
  compatible.

- Support for dynlink in js_of_ocaml.

- Logging improvements in Eliom and Server, in particular on
  the client side.

- A healthy amount of bugfixes.


The next releases will probably see major changes. The current plan
is:

- Replace Server's internals with cohttp, as part of our
  move towards Mirage-compatible libraries. See [here](https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigenserver/issues/54).

- Shared_react, which allows to build reactive pages from server side. See [here](https://github.com/ocsigen/eliom/issues/162).

- PPX for Eliom.

- Support for async/core in js_of_ocaml.

 Have fun with Ocsigen!
